# Newsread 

## What? 
News Web application. I Used Django for the serverside logic and bootstrap for my templates. 
The differents news articles are collected using NewsApi.

## User registration
It is possible to use the site without creating a user profile, but it is recommended to create one. Indeed, creating one allows you to choose the newspapers you wish to be displayed.
A system of password reset by email has also been implemented. You just have to enter your email adress and a mail containing a reset link will be sent. Note that the adress mail has to mach the one used when creating your profile. 

## Forms 
There is diffenrents forms used in this app, most of them are made using the Django bult-in forms classes. For the style I used Crispy Forms and Bootstrap.
